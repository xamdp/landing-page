# Project: Landing Page
Basically there are (4) four main parts the landing page has.

- Header and Hero
- Content
    - About 
    - Projects
    - Call to action or (subscribe)
- Footer

As the lesson suggested from the The Odin Project: Landing Page it can be overwhelming to look at a blank HTML document and now know where
to start. The suggestion is: **take it one section at a time**.

I've decided to make this a personalized project.

Header will contain my logo and links. As for the links it will be (About me, Blog, Project and link to my GitHub profile)

The project section can be inserted between about and quote.

As for the images I have used, they belong to the rightful owners which I think the distributions itself.
