# Project: Landing Page

Basically there are (4) four main parts the landing page has.

- Header and Hero
- Content
    - Information
    - Quote
    - Call to Action
- Footer

As the lesson suggested from the The Odin Project: Landing Page it can be overwhelming to look at a blank HTML document and now know where
to start. The suggestion is: take it one section at a time.
